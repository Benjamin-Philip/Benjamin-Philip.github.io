title: SICP Ex 1.1
tags: [SICP, Lisp, Scheme]
---

So I had just started reading SICP. It's this amazing book that was used 
to teach Comp Sc. to students who had never programmed before at MIT.
When I thought that I should write a blog post with a solution for every 
exercise I attempt. So I am gonna write solutions for all the exercise in
SICP. My plan is to finish this book in one year.

# My setup

My plan is to use emacs(sorry for the adultery vim!) with slime, and guile.
I haven't setup it up yet, though I will attach a link to the post when I do. 
I strongly encourage you to setup emacs though because soon the exercises will
get really complicated, and the support emacs has for Lisp (Being written in lisp itself)
will be really helpful while editing.

So without further delay, Let's get to the exercise

# The Question

**Exercise 1.1:** Below is a sequence of expressions. What is the result
printed by the interpreter in response to each expression? Assume that the
sequence is to be evaluated in the order in which presented.

```scheme
10
(+ 5 3 4)
(- 9 1)
(/ 6 2)
(+ (* 2 4) (- 4 6))
(define a 3)
(define b (+ a 1))
(+ a b (* a b))
(= a b)
(if (and (> b a) (< b (* a b)))
    b
    a)
(cond ((= a 4) 6)
      ((= b 4) (+ 6 7 a))
      (else 25))
(+ 2 (if (> b a) b a))
(* (cond) ((> a b) a)
          ((< a b) b)
          (else -1))
   (+ a 1)
```

# My Thoughts

So far, the authors have been explaining about the basic syntax
of scheme. If you are reading this, you most likely also read SICP till
this exercise. So I am not gonna speak much about it, but make a table
of the syntax:

|Scheme syntax|English equivalent| Python equivalent|
:--------------------------------|:------------------|:---------------------------------|
| (define <variable> <value>)                 | variable is value                                      | variable = value                 |
| define (<name> <formal parameters>) <body>) | to do name, do body with the help of formal parameters | def <name>(<formal parameters>): |
| (<name> <parameters>)                       | using a function                                       | <name>(<parameters>)             |
| (cond (<p1> <e1>)
	(<p2><e2>))                          | if p1 is true, do e1 or if p2 is true, do do e2| e1 if p1 e2 elif p2|
|
