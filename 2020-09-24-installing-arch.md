This is not a task for the light hearted. If you
want to use a Linux system and have an easy guided
setup (and use), check these out: [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).
If you want something Arch-based, use this: [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
and for the people who want something like RHEL: [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
And those who want something Suse based: [OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)
These Distros will hold your hand through out your journey.

Now if you want to know why I have been so discouraging about
using Arch, It's because it is a Linux Distro for people
who want their own personalised computer. Sure it is not as
extreme as [LFS](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/), or
[Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) But it is not easy to maintain and
use. It takes a lot effort not to foil up the setup and not have your
computer break when you update. (Which is every week/day, because Arch is
Rolling Release)

So here is tutorial (more accurate is my experience) for the folks
out there who want to use arch but want a little help during the
installation.

**Warning:** The Author himself agrees he is not perfect. 
There are tons who are better.

**Note:** To all the Arch users who do know what they are
doing, if you find a mistake, please write a comment.
Along with an link to an explanation.

 **Warning:** Now the most important note is that this article is just the installation.
We are just installing arch on the disk. We are not setting up the 
Desktop Environment. The max we'll do is just add a user.

Few links before we start:
