title: How to setup WSL and a Linux distribution in 15 minutes

This year, I bought a new laptop. It came with a Windows Installation.
Since, it also came with Word, Excel, and Power point (tools that I can but my family 
can't live without), I decided to keep the Windows Installation. The Problem
is that my software warranty goes void if I dual boot it to Linux and there
goes all the support for Microsoft Office. Luckily though I found a solution:
Windows Subsystem for Linux. 

# What I will be covering

This blog will explain how to :

1. Install WSL 2

2. Install a Linux Distribution

3. Setup that Linux Distribution (Adding a User)

4. How to use Linux for your work

# Step 1: Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux

Now in order to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux,
we need to enable it. To do so open Powershell as Admin and run:

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

# Step 2: Enable the Virtual Machine feature

Before installing the Linux Kernel, we need to enable the
Virtual Machine Feature. Run the following in Powershell:

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

Now, you must restart your computer so that WSL will install. (Remember Windows sucks and needs 
to Reboot for the slightest change)

# Step 3: Download the Linux Kernel

We now install the Linux Kernel

{: .note-box}
**Note:** The package here differs for x64 machines and ARM machines. Be sure to download the right installer.

Run the program downloaded with the link with elevated permissions

Here are the links:

- [x64](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi)
- [ARM](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_arm64.msi)

# Step 4: Set WSL 2 as your default version

We will now set WSL2 as our default version.

Run this in Powershell:

```powershell
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

{: .note-box}
**Note:** If `wsl --set-default-version 2` doesn't work, you most likely have a build below 18362.
You will have to update to version 1903, Build 18362 or higher. (Unless you are okay with WSL 1)

# Step 5: Choose a distro and Install it

We now need to choose a Linux distro and Install it.
Currently you can only use Microsoft Store though
there will be a new [powershell command](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/distro-installation-added-to-wsl-install-in-windows-10-insiders-preview-build-20246/) as well.

Open Microsoft Store and search for Linux:

![Linux Distros pic]({{ page.assets-var | append: '/store.png'}})

Now all you have to do is Install a distro of your choice.
Once its done, all you will need to type in a Unix username and a password


![Ubuntu Installation]({{ page.assets-var | append: '/store.png'}})

# What do you use WSL for?

Most of the people who install WSL are people who do technical
work that is a pain to do in Vanilla windows. I personally
use it for editing stuff on vim, programming in python, bash, scheme etc.
I also use a lot of the Unix tools that I am used to, like par for formatting,
chron for executing regular scripts, fortune and cowsay for amusing myself.
